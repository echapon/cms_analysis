- computeSignificance_PFLHC.C: compute significance using a likelihood scan. Also includes code to plot the likelihood scan at the end (with a pre-defined class or by hand)
- computeSignif.C: compute singificance using hypothesis testing (toys or asymptotic approximation; default = toys)
- submit_jobs_signif.sh: submits jobs on lxplus for the toys for the significance with toys
  - combine all the outputs using hadd_hypotestresult.C: instructions to compile it given in the beginning of the file
- test the statistical uncertainty using a toy study: coverage_nosyst.C
